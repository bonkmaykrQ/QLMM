# Quake Live Mod Manager
Free software mod manager for Quake Live, designed for Microsoft Windows 10.

# Building
Building requires Visual Studio 2019 or any similar version. There is no linux version of QLMM or VS2019, so if you are using WINE, you will need to use a pre-compiled binary instead.  
If you haven't already, install Visual Studio 2019, and any neccessary dependencies.  
    
Open the .sln file with Visual Studio, and press F7.  
  
Note that you may need to disable assembly signing in the project settings.
