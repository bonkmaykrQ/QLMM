If you are having issues with QLMM, please ensure that you are using THE LATEST VERSION. I periodically improve QLMM on my free time and use it myself very frequently, so if you have a bug you need to report for an older version, it's highly likely I've already fixed it.

When reporting a bug, please provide the following information:
- What you think causes the bug, and how to trigger it again (if possible)
- Any steps you have taken to try and mitigate the issue, and whether or not each of them worked. This helps me get a general idea of what could be causing your problem.
- The earliest known version the bug has occurred in. This helps greatly since it allows me to pinpoint precisely what changes introduced the bug. 
- Your configuration files for QLMM, the version of Windows or WINE that you are using, and any other relevant information that may help me track down the issue. **DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.** We do not need this information, will never ask for it, and do not want it.
